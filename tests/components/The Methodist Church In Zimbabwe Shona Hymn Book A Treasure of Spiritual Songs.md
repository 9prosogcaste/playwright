## The History of the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe
 
The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe traces its origins to the British Methodist mission activity in former Southern Rhodesia, which began in 1891. The first Methodist church was built in Bulawayo in 1893, and was later relocated to Matopos area[^4^]. The mission expanded to other parts of the country, such as Harare, Mutare, Masvingo, Gweru, and Matabeleland. The mission also reached out to neighboring countries, such as Angola, Congo (DRC), Mozambique, and Zambia. The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe faced many challenges during the colonial era and the liberation struggle, which resulted in a decline of membership and resources. However, the church also played a significant role in promoting education, health care, social justice, and ecumenism.
 
The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe gained its autonomy from the Methodist Church in Britain in 1977[^1^] [^3^]. It became part of the Africa Central Conference, which was later subdivided into several episcopal areas. The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe has four episcopal areas: Harare East, Harare West, Bulawayo-Midlands-Masvingo-Matabeleland South (BMMS), and Mutare-Manicaland-Mashonaland East (MMM). The church has about 300 ordained ministers and over 2000 local preachers who serve more than 3000 congregations. The church has a membership of about 1.5 million people[^4^]. The church is led by a bishop who is elected by the central conference for a term of six years. The current bishop is Rev. Dr. Solomon Zwana who was elected in 2018.
 
The Methodist Church in Zimbabwe is committed to fulfilling its mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. The church has various ministries and programs that cater for different groups and needs, such as women, youth, children, men, evangelism, education, health, development, justice and peace, ecumenism, and interfaith dialogue. The church also partners with other churches and organizations locally and internationally to enhance its mission and witness. Some of the partners include: The United Methodist Church (USA), The Methodist Church in Britain, The World Council of Churches (WCC), The All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC), The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC), The Christian Care (CC), and The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
